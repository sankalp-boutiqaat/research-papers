Network Access Control List:

A NACL is a firewall (security layer) which controls traffic moving in and out of one or more subnets.

NOTE: the default VPC already has a NACL in place. However, it has all inbound/outbound traffic allowed.
 
NACL's have 2 types of rules for controlling traffic:
a:) Inbound rules: Applies for incoming traffic to subnets.
b:) Outbound rules: Applies for outgoing trafifc from subnets.
[FIG: VPC video5 2:07]

Rules are evaluated based on rule numbers, the rule with lower rule number gets priority over higher one.
As soon as a traffic type matches a rule that rule is applied to for the traffic type neglecting all lower priority rules.

ex:

Rule no.            type           port          Action
 80                 HTTP            80           ALLOW
 90                 HTTP            80           DENY
 100                 ALL            ALL          DENY

In this example, when a HTTP traffic will come on port 80, it will be allowed entry in subnet, as the RULE 80 will match and get evaluated
and all the other rules will be ignored. However, if a HTTP traffic will come on port 8080 it will not be allowed, as it will match up
RULE 100 which states to block all traffic.

Rule no.            type           port          Action
 70                  ALL            ALL          DENY
 80                 HTTP            80           ALLOW
 90                 HTTP            80           DENY
 100                 ALL            ALL          ALLOW

In this example, none of the traffic will be allowed entry in subnet as each traffic will match the RULE 70 and so rest
all the rules will get ignored and the traffic will simple be restricted.

Note:
 -> A NACL can have multiple subnets under its hood but a subnet can belong to only one NACL at a time.
    i.e a subnet cannot be associated with two NACL's
 -> NACL controls the traffic in/out of subnet once inside the subnet AWS resources may have their own controlling rules.

NAcl's are stateless, so return traffic must be allowed through an Outbound rule.
For example: In order for a HTTP server to function, the NACL should allow incoming traffic to port 80 as well as allow all outgoing traffic
from port 80.



Security Groups:
----------------------------

Security are very similar to NACL's, they are also used to allow/deny traffic. HOwever, securitry groups are used on the instance level instead of at subnet level.
As, one NACL can havle multiple subnets under its hood, A single security group can have multiple instances under its hood.

Security groups also have inbound and outbound rules just like NACL.

One more important difference b/w security group and NACL is how security rules work:
 - Security groups only support allow rules, i.e you cannot specify any deny rules. If something is not explicitely allowed, it will be considered as denied.
 - Security groups are stateful, so return traffic is automatically allowed.
 - All rules are evaluated before deciding whether to allow a traffic. Thus no rule priority.
