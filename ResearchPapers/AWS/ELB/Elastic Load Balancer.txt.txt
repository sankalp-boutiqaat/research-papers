Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):
-------------------------------------

Load balancing is a very common method of distributing incoming traffic among servers.

An Elastic load balancer is an AWS service which can distribute the traffic among multiple EC2 instances. Thus, reducing
the load on each instance. The distribution is done in round-robin fashion.

An ELB can distribute the traffic to EC2's residing in different subnets and different availibility zones. Thus ELB service
is not limited to availibity zones.

An ELB has its own DNS record set, thus can be directly accessed from internet.

ELB automatically detects the unhealthy instances and stop sending the traffic to those instances.

ELB's are generally used with Auto Scaling Group to provide high-availibility, elasticity and fault-tolerant infrastructure.

There are two types of load balancers as provided by AWS:
1. Classic load balancer   : Is a normal balancer which routes traffic to EC2 machines based on the round-robin fashion.
2. Application load balancer : It follows slightly advanced routing technique, where you can choose based on URL path params, hostname
       and HTTP headers to which target group request is to be transferred. 
A target group can contain multiple EC2 machines and traffic will be routed to 
them in round-robin fashion.
