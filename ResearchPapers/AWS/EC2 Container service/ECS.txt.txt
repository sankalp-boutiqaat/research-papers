EC2 Container Service (ECS):
-------------------------

ECS is a container management service provided by AWS. It supports Docker containers.
It allows you to easily create and manage multiple docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances.

Why use ECS or containers?
-------------------------------
It allows for microservice service architecture where each task(microservice) is independently deployable, 
managable and Scalable.

How it works?
-----------------------------

There is an ECS agent installed on each of EC2 instance within the cluster.
The role of this ECS agent is to start or stop docker container when asked.
 
IMP: Containers are known as tasks in ECS terminology. 

Each Task/container has a definition file associated to it, called as task definition file. 
A task definition file is a JSON formatted file that contains information about how a task/container is to be started. 
It contains:
 - Which docker image to use.
 - On which repository image is located
 - Which ports will be used by container
 - What data volumes will be used with containers.

ECS Terminology:
--------------------
1. Task Definition: It is a blueprint that describes how a docker container should be launched.
    It contains information like: exposed ports, docker image to be used, environment variables, 
    memory and cpu requirements.

2. Task: The actual running docker container is called a task. 
      A task is also seen as a running instance of a task definition.

3. Service: A group of tasks all running the same task definition is called a Service.

4. Cluster: An ECS cluster is made of a fleet of EC2 instances. Which are capable of running Tasks.

5. Container Instance: A single EC2 within the ECS Cluster is called a Container Instance.
