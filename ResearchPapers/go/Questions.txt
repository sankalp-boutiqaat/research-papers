  (done) Value types vs Reference types.
  (done) allowed tokens during printing (%v,%d,%s etc), when to use what.

3. (done) Array and slices


   Read from stdin and write to a file.

5. Structs.
     (done) Size calculation for slice, string and bool 
	 
6. Goroutines.
       (done) Diff b/w concurreny and parallalism
