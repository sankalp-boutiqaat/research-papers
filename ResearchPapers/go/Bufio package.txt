Handling io using bufio package:
Reader:
--------
The role of the reader is to read data from supplied io.reader object into a buffer.
The read is throttled using the buffer size, so that the memory does not get overflow with very huge buffer.

type Reader struct {
	buf          []byte    // buffer into which data is to be read from io.Reader. Default buffer size is 4096 bytes, minimum buffer size is 16 bytes. 
	rd           io.Reader // reader provided by the client
	r, w         int       // pointer positions for read and write.
	err          error     // it contains any error found during read.
	lastByte     int
	lastRuneSize int
}

The *Reader object can be obtained using helper functions: NewReader and NewReaderSize

func NewReader(rd io.Reader) *Reader {
	//Initialize a *Reader, to read from io.Reader with buffer size of 4096 bytes.
}

func NewReaderSize(rd io.Reader, size int) *Reader {
   //Initialize a *Reader, to read from io.Reader with buffer size as provided in input.
}

The Operations that can be done on *Reader object:

func (b *Reader) Reset(r io.Reader) {
	//Discards everything thats in the current buffer, including the io.Reader that was set previously in Reader object.
	//Sets provided io.Reader as the new object to read from.
	//Its just like initializing a new Reader object.
}

func (b *Reader) Peek(n int) ([]byte, error) {
   // Peek return the next n bytes, without advancing the read pointer.
   // This means that calling peek twice with same value for n will return same bytes as the read pointer does not move ahead.  
}

func (b *Reader) Discard(n int) (discarded int, err error) {
   //Discards n bytes from the buffer i.e the read pointer will be simply shifted to n positions ahead.
}

func (b *Reader) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
   //The motive of this function is to read the data from Reader buffer into supplied buffer p.
   //The important point is how's this done? following is the logic for it:
   // Check if we have any unread data in our Reader buffer, if so copy it to supplied byte slice p and return.
   // If we dont have any unread data, two cases arise:
   //   1.) Size of supplied buffer p is greater than our Reader buffer, Then, Read only ONCE from io.Reader object and copy directly to suuplied buffer p.
            Instead of copying first to Reader buffer and then copying to p.
        2.) Size of supplied buffer p is less than our Reader buffer, Then, Read only ONCE from io.Reader object into Reader buffer and then copy
            as much as possible to supplied buffer p. 		
}

func (b *Reader) ReadByte() (byte, error) {
  //Read only one byte from Reader buffer.
  //if the reader buffer is empty use fill() and then return one byte.
  //See fill() for more description.
}
func (b *Reader) UnreadByte() error {
 //Put the last read byte back to Reader buffer.
 //How do we know, which was the last read byte??
 // ANS: this is where the lastByte property of Reader struct comes in effect.
  //NOTE: lastByte does not contain the actual byte data but only the buffer index where last byte is found.
  //This will usually be b.r - 1  
}

func (b *Reader) fill() {
  // fill reads a new chunk into the buffer.
  // Read from io.Reader object and fill Reader buffer till atleast one byte is received.
  // Do not try more than 100 times. 
}

func (b *Reader) ReadRune() (r rune, size int, err error) {
  //Instead of reading a single byte, it reads a rune. A rune can be anywhere between 1-4 bytes.
  
}

func (b *Reader) UnreadRune() error {
  // Instead of Putting the last read byte back to Reader buffer. It puts the rune back to buffer.
  // This is where the lastRuneSize comes into effect. which helps in getting the size of rune to put back.
}

func (b *Reader) Buffered() int {
  //Returns the number of pending unread bytes in Reader buffer.
}

func (b *Reader) ReadSlice(delim byte) (line []byte, err error) {
 //The Aim is to read and return contents till the delimeter is encountered.
 //If the delimeter is found in the Reader buffer, contents upto the delimeter are returned.
 //If not, New data is loaded into buffer using fill() method and again delimeter is searched in the buffer.
 //If still delimeter is not found, above step is repeated, till the point delimeter is not found OR io.Reader gives io.EOF OR buffer gets FULL.
 //NOTE: this method does not provide the surity that whole io.Reader data will be read until the delimeter is found.
 //   There may be a case where Redaer buffer max size is 10 bytes.
 //   unread bytes is 5 bytes, io.Reader has 20 bytes more pending to be read.
 //   Now, since the max capacity of buffer is only 10 bytes. the above function will return once the buffer gets full i.e after reading 
 //   next 5 bytes from io.Reader, Thus there still will be 15 bytes to be read from io.Reader which may contain our required delimeter.
 //   So, the above function should be called in for loop till we keep getting buffer full error.
 //   Also, once a buffer full is encountered whole buffer is reset to 0. So, the returned data on each iteration must be stored on a tempory byte slice.
 
}

func (b *Reader) ReadLine() (line []byte, isPrefix bool, err error) {
  // This is same as calling ReadSlice('\n').
  // isPrefix => denotes whether full line till delimeter is retrieved or a next call needs to be made
  //             to above function again.
  // so basically instead of checking for buffer full error, we simply need to check for isPrefix.
}

func (b *Reader) ReadBytes(delim byte) ([]byte, error) {
  //NOTE: If you want to read whole data of io.reader without wrrying about Reader buffer getting full, Then this is the method.
  //  It returns data upto the delimeter, reading recursively from the io.Reader till delim is found.
  //   BUT, BEWARE this might not seem to be most logical approach when dealing with large files.  
  // NOTE: Internally it calls readSlice(delim), maintaining the tempory buffer and expanding it when necessary.   
}

func (b *Reader) ReadString(delim byte) (string, error) {
   //Same as readBytes, only the difference is it returns string.
}

func (b *Reader) WriteTo(w io.Writer) (n int64, err error) {
  //If you are performing a task of reading from one io media and writing to another io media.
  //This is the function that will make best sence.
  //What it does is, it reads from io.Reader and flushes to io.Writer. How??
  //    - First, Flush all unread bytes to io.Writer.
  //    - Now, Read from io.Reader to Reader buffer and again flush to io.Writer.
  //    - Keep doing above step till reader says I dont have more data to give you buddy.
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The role of writer is to write data from buffer to io.Writer.

type Writer struct {
	err error       //error if any
	buf []byte      // Writer buffer. 
	n   int         // pointer to last unwritten byte in buffer(buf). 
	wr  io.Writer   // writer object
}

The *Writer object can be obtained by using the following helper functions:

func NewWriterSize(w io.Writer, n int) *Writer {
   //Creates a *Writer object with buffer length of n and pointing to io.Writer. 
}

func NewWriter(w io.Writer) *Writer {
  //Same as calling NewWriterSize() with buffer size of 4096 bytes.    
}

The following operations can be performed on a *Writer object:

func (b *Writer) Reset(w io.Writer) {
  //As its name implies, Resets the whole writer buffer. 
}

func (b *Writer) Flush() error {
  //Simply writes all the available data in buffer to io.Writer. 
}

func (b *Writer) Available() int {
  //Amount of space available in writer buffer.
}

func (b *Writer) Buffered() int {
  //No. of bytes in buffer.
}

func (b *Writer) Write(p []byte) (nn int, err error) {
  //Write writes the data supplied in p to Writer buffer.
  //If the size of supplied p is greater than Writer Buffer, the access data is flushed to io.Writer.
}

func (b *Writer) WriteByte(c byte) error {
  //Write the supplied byte to Writer buffer.
  //If the buffer is full, first Flush() all buffer data to io.Writer.
  //then write the byte to Writer buffer.
}

func (b *Writer) WriteRune(r rune) (size int, err error) {
    //Same as writebyte except Writes the supplied rune to buffer.
}

func (b *Writer) WriteString(s string) (int, error) {
  //Same as Write(), with the only difference that it takes string.
}

func (b *Writer) ReadFrom(r io.Reader) (n int64, err error) {
   // This method is exactly same as WriteTo() method of a Reader.
   // It reads from the supplied io.Reader in a buffered manner and writes to the io.Writer, when the Writer buffer is fully loaded.
   //  to free up space.   
}
