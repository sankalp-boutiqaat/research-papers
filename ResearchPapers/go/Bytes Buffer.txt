Public functions:

func NewBuffer(b []byte) *Buffer
  => Initializes new Buffer with 'b' as the initial contents.

func NewBufferString(s string) *Buffer
  => same as above func just accepts string as input instead of byte slice.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

func (b *Buffer) Bytes() []byte
  => Retruns the unread portion of buffer slice.

func (b *Buffer) String() string
  => Same as above just returns the unread portion as string.

func (b *Buffer) Len() int
  => Returns the number of unread bytes.

func (b *Buffer) Cap() int
  => Returns max capacity of buffer.

func (b *Buffer) Reset()
  => Discard whole buffer

func (b *Buffer) Truncate(n int)
  => Discard whole buffer, just preserve the supplied number of unread bytes.

func (b *Buffer) Grow(n int)
  => Grows the buffer size by n.

func (b *Buffer) Write(p []byte) int
  => appends to the current contents of buffer.

func (b *Buffer) ReadFrom(r io.Reader) (n int64)
  => takes the io.Reader interface and reads its contents into buffer.
  => It reads entire contents in Buffer till EOF is encountered.
  => Reading is done in chunks of 512 bytes.

func (b *Buffer) WriteTo(w io.Writer) (n int64
  => Writes buffer data into io.Writer interface till full buffer is drained.

func (b *Buffer) WriteByte(c byte)
  => Append byte 'c' to buffer.

func (b *Buffer) WriteRune(r rune) (n int)
  => Write unicode code point to buffer.

func (b *Buffer) Read(p []byte) (n int)
  => Read bytes from buffer and fill in supplied slice 'p'. 
  => Number of bytes read == len(p)

func (b *Buffer) Next(n int) []byte
  => Read next n bytes from buffer.

func (b *Buffer) UnreadByte() error
  => unread most recent read byte
