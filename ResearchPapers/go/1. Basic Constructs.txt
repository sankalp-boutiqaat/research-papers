1. The language is case-sensitive.

2. All File names are in snake case. (i.e lower case, seperated via underscore.), no spaces or special characters allowed.  

3. Statements does not need to end in semi-colon. Go compiler automatically inserts semicolons at the end of statements. However if multiple statements are written on one line,they must be separated by ; (semi colon)

4. When a program executes, the first function to be called after initilaizations is the main() function.
main() function has no arguments and no return values.


      ## Packages: ##
1. Every go-file belongs to one (and only one) package.
2. Many different .go files can belong to one package, so the filename(s) and package name are generally not the same.
3. A standalone executable belongs to package main. Each Go application contains one package called main.
4. Each directory contains one package.

To build a program, all the packages, and the files within them, must be compiled in the correct order. Package dependencies determine the order in which to build packages.
The package is compiled as a unit, i.e all source files within a package must be compiled together and by convention each directory contains one package.

NOTE: If a package is changed and recompiled, all the client programs that use this package must be recompiled too!

If A.go depends on B.go which depends on C.go:
- compile C.go, B.go, then A.go.
- to compile A.go, compiler reads B.o not C.o.

import “fmt” tells Go that this program needs (functions, or other elements, from) the package
fmt. The package names are enclosed within “”. 
Import loads the public declarations from the compiled package, it does not insert the sourcecode.

If the name of a package does not start with . or /, like “fmt” or “container/list”, Go looks for it in
the global Go tree. If it starts with ./ the package is searched in the actual directory; starting with /
(even on Windows) it is searched for in the (absolute) path indicated.

Packages expose their code-objects to the code outside of the package according to the following rule,
which is enforced by the compiler :

visibility rule:
When the identifier ( of a constant, variable, type, function, struct field, …) starts with an
uppercase letter, like Group1, then the ‘object’ with this identifier is visible in code outside
the package (thus available to client-programs, ‘importers’ of the package), it is said to be
exported (like public in OO languages). Identifiers which start with a lowercase letter are
not visible outside the package, but they are visible and usable in the whole package (like
private).
Remark: importing a package which is not used in the rest of the code is a build-error (for
example: imported and not used: os)


Comments:
One line comment: //
Multi line block comment: /* */



Sample program execution:
	

The order of execution (program startup ) of a Go application is as follows:
(1) all packages in package main are imported in the order as indicated,
in every package:
(2) if it imports packages, (1) is called for this package (recursively)
but a certain package is imported only once
(3) then for every package (in reverse order) all constants and variables are evaluated, and the
init() if it contains this function.
(4) at last in package main the same happens, and then main() starts executing.


conversions:
Conversion from one type of value to another type needs to be done explicitely(manually), go does not support implicit (automatic) conversion
But this can only succeed in certain well defined cases, for example from a narrower type to a
broader type (for example: int16 to int32). When converting from a broader type to a narrower
type (for example: int32 to int16, or float32 to int) loss of value (truncation) can occur.


Constant:
 constant const contains data which does not change.
This data can only be of type boolean, number (integer, float or complex) or string.
ex: const b string = “abc”
IOTA trick??????????
https://splice.com/blog/iota-elegant-constants-golang/


Constants must be evaluated at compile time; a const can be defined as a calculation, but all the
values necessary for the calculation must be available at compile time.
Note: Specifing type with constant declaration in optional.
So this is ok: const c1 = 2/3
this is NOT: const c2 = getNumber()// gives the build error: getNumber() used as value

Multi assignment is possible, ex:
const beef, two, c = “meat”, 2, “veg”
const Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6



  ## Variables: ##
----------------------------------------------------
A declaration of a variable with var automatically initializes it to the zero-value defined for its type.
Types can be :
a:)elementary (or primitive), like int, float, bool, string,
b:)structured (or composite), like struct, array, slice, map, channel,
c:)interfaces, which only describe the behavior of a type.



Variable scope:
-----------------
1. A variable declared outside of a function has global or package scope, i.e it is available throughout that package.
2. A variable declared inside of a function has local scope and is available only within that function.
3. A variable declared inside a control struct such as if-else, switch, for etc have block level scope.

Variable Shadowing:
--------------------
1. If a variable is declared in the local scope with the name that conflicts with another variable present in global scope, then the 
priority is given to local scope variable and the global scope variable is said to be shadowed within that function.
Note: Same concept applies for block level too.  

var a int       // variable declaration
a = 15          // variable assignment 
var a int = 15  // var assignment + declaration
a := 15         // short declaration syntax
var a = 15      // Automatic type inference
var a, b, c int
var a, b, c int = 10, 11, 12 // parallel or simulataneous assignment.
a, b, c := 10, 11, "hello"

Go compiler has the ability to derive the type of variable from its value, this is called Automatic type inference.
NOTE: Short declaration syntax cannot be used at Package level.

Value types and Reference types:
-----------------------------------
1. Value types: All primary types (int, float, strings, bool etc) + Arrays, Structs
     - variables of value type are contained in Stack memory.
2. Reference types: Slices, Maps, Channels, Pointers.
     - variables of reference types are stored in heap.

Swap two variables A, B:
--------------------------

B, A = A, B //swapped in single line.


  ##Functions:##
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A public function uses PascalCasing, a normal func uses camelCasing.

A function can return more than one variable, then the return-types are indicated separated by
comma’s and surrounded by ( ), like: func FunctionName (a typea, b typeb) (t1 type1, t2
type2). Then return takes the form: return var1, var2

init() function:
--------------------
This is a special function, which is executed automatically before main() function of the package main.
 - A source file can contain only one init() function.
 - init() function cannot be called explicitely.

 
Format Specifiers:
=================================

%v  => uses default specifier for the supplied variable. (%t for booleaon, %d for int etc)
%+v => in case of struct prints field names as well.
%#v => Prints In Go's representation.
%T  => prints type of variable.

%t => booleon

%d => int
%b => int base 2
%o => int base 8
%x => int base 16

%U => unicode code point for the character.
%c => character represented via code point.
%s => string

%f => float


Numerical Data types:
-------------------------------------------------

1. Architecture dependent types: These depend on the computer architecture on which the program will run. In 32 bit systems
they occupy 32 bit and on 64 bit systems thaey take 64 bits.
Types: int, uint, uintptr 

2. Architecture independent types: These take fixed size and does not depend on computer on which program is run.
Types:
  int8,  uint8 ->   8 bits
  int16, uint16 -> 16 bits
  int32, uint32 -> 32 bits
  int64, uint64 -> 64 bits
  
  float32, float64

Note: int8 and int16 are different types, explicit conversion needs to be done to convert one to another:
    var n int8 = 2
    var m int16
    m = n // not possible
    m = int16(n) // works!!


Aliasing Types:
------------------------------------------------------------------

A type can also be given another name, such as:
"type TimeZone int"
in this, int is aliased as TimeZone.
However, for Go compiler these are two different types, so an explicit conversion is needed while doing something like this:
        type TZ int
	var a int = 5
	var b TZ
	b = TZ(a)
	fmt.Printf("%v", b)

Characters:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A character is represented as a byte, which is actually an alias of uint8.
In ASCII table, decimal value for A is 65 and hexadecimal is \x41. So A can be declared as:
var ch byte = 65 or var ch byte = '\x41'
An ASCII character takes only 1 byte, but there is also support for Unicode characters(UTF-8) which can consume upto 6 bytes.
Unicode characters are represented in codepoints or what is called as runes. Runes are an alias for int32 datatype.

A unicode code point is represented as U+hhhh, where 'h' is a hexa decimal number. More precisely, something like this:
\u0041 (\u followed by 4 hexa chars) or \U00101234 (\U followed by 8 hexa chars)
Incase, unicode character can fit in 2 bytes we use first representation format, incase it needs more bytes we use second one.

  var ch1 rune = '\u0041'
  var ch2 rune = '\U00101234'
  
  fmt.Printf("%d %d", ch1, ch2)   // 65   1053236
  fmt.Printf("%U %U", ch1, ch2)   // U+0041   U+101234
  fmt.Printf("%c %c", ch1, ch2)   // A       []

utf8 package provides conversion from rune to []bytes and vice-versa.
A rune can be converted to []byte by using utf8.EncodeRune(), and []byte to rune by using utf.DecodeRune()

Strings:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Go strings are stored as UTF-8. So, strings are a sequence of variable-length characters.
Each character can take 1-6 bytes for storage. If its a ASCII character it will take 1 byte else it will take more than that.

String are represented as:
Interpreted Strings => enclosed in double codes. In this special characters such as \n, \t, \u are interpreted. 
Raw String => enclosed in backtick (not single quotes)

The initial value of a string is empty string ("").

A string can be seen as a slice of bytes. So simple indexing can be used to access contents of a string.

var str string = "hello"

str[0] => represents first byte.
str[1] => represents second byte.
Since, ASCII characters take up only 1 byte: str[0] == "h" and str[1] == "e".
NOTE: Beware, this will not be true when dealing with non ASCII chars.

Strings are immutable, which means they cannot be modified. Thus following operation is invalid:
str[0] = 'A'
Also, one cannot take address of a sting byte: &str[0] is invalid.
To modify a string one first needs to convert string to a slice of bytes, and then can use indexes to modify it.
s:="hello"
c := []byte(s)
c[0] = 'c'
s2 := string(c) // s2 == "cello"
xptr := &c[0] // Also, now u can take address of element xptr == 0xsd233e00ed


Two strings can be concatenated as:

str = Str1 + Str2
However, using such operation in a loop is not very efficient. Try using strings.Join() and ever better is byte-buffer.

len(str) => gives the number of bytes in a string.

A for-range loop can be used to iterate over characters of the string (not bytes).

        var ch string = "hòla"

	for k, v := range ch {
		fmt.Printf("\n index:%d, value:%c, intv:%d", k, v, v)
	}
Outputs:
 index:0, value:h, intv:104
 index:1, value:ò, intv:242   //this character took 2 bytes.
 index:3, value:l, intv:108
 index:4, value:a, intv:97

For normal case:
        var ch string = "hola"

	for k, v := range ch {
		fmt.Printf("\n index:%d, value:%c, intv:%d", k, v, v)
	}
Outputs:
 index:0, value:h, intv:104
 index:1, value:o, intv:111   
 index:3, value:l, intv:108
 index:4, value:a, intv:97

This method can be used to calculate number of characters in case string has non-ASCII chars.
utf8.RuneCountInString(str) can also be used to get number of characters in string.

A string can be converted to slice of rune, simply via:
var r = []rune(str) // length of rune will give the number of characters.
And slice of rune can be converted to string via:
var s = string(runes)



Conversion of string to int and floats and vice-versa:
--------------------------------------------------------

strconv package is used for such conversions. 
strconv.Itoa() => convert int to string
strconv.Atoi() => convert string to int

strconv.FormatFloat() => convert float to str
strconv.ParseFloat() => convert str to float


Pointers:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pointers are special datatype which can store address of a object. 

The address of an object can be extracted by using the address-of operator (&). This operator when placed
before a variable gives the memory address of that variable.

        var i1 = 5
	fmt.Printf("\n value:%v, address:%v", i1, &i1)
        //output:  value:5, address:0xc42000e2b8

A pointer variable can be declared as:
var intP *int
(It stores the address of a variable which points to integer value)
  var i1 = 5
  var intP *int
  intP = &i1

A pointer takes 64bit (8 bytes) on 64bit systems and 32 bit on 32bit systems.

The default value of a pointer is nil.

Using the * operator to get the actual value of the pointer is called dereferencing or indirection.
ex: fmt.Printf("\n%v", *intP) //intP pointer is dereferenced.

POinter arithmetic is not allowed in GO, means following is invalid:
intP = intP + 2
or, intP++

Pointed variables persist in memory as long as there is atleast one pointer pointing to it. So, their lifetime is independent
of the scope in which they were created.

Nesting of pointers is allowed. So, a pointer can point to another pointer which points to another pointer and so on.

Dereferencing a nil pointer will make the process crash.
ex: var p *int
    *p = 0 //nil pointer dereference. 


new() and make():
------------------------------------------

- Both are used to allocate memory.
- Both allocates memory on heap.

The difference is that new() is meant to be used with value type structures like: structs, arrays.
make() is meant to be used with reference type structures such as slices, maps, channels.

new() allocates memory and provides a pointer to that location.
make() allocates memory and returns initialized value.  


HOw to define basic package structure?
----------------------------------------
myproj/
   - main/
       - main.go
   - pack1/
       - pack1.go
	   - pack3/
   	       - pack3.go
   - pack2/
       - pack2.go

The above program can be run as:
-> move to myproj folder
-> go run main/main.go
-> go build main/main.go (to compile)	   

In the above example, 
  - pack1 can be imported within main.go  as:  import("../pack1")
  - pack2 can be imported within pack1.go as:  import("../pack2")
  - pack3 can be imported within pack2.go as:  import("./pack2")    



How package referencing works?
----------------------------------
  Referencing is used when importing a particular package within another package.
  or
  in go get [importpath], go install [importpath], go build [importpath], go run [importpath] like commands.

If the importpath of package starts with a . or .. element, it is assumed to be a filesystem path.
Otherwise, the package is searched within GOPATH/src. 

Wildcard -> "..." is a wildcard replacement for "*".
So, In order to test all the subdirectories within package "net", we can simply say
  go test net/... 
   or we can move to net directory and say,
   go test ./...   
This will compile net package, will also compile net/http package and will also compile net/http/server package.
