## Basics:
---
MongoDB stores records as BSON documents. BSON is a binary serialization for JSON documents and supports 
all the datatypes provided by json, plus a couple more.

Documents are composed of field and value:

```json
{
    name : "sue",
    age  : 26,
    status:"A",
    groups: ["news", "sports"]
    manager:{name: "merlyn"}
}
```
All these documents are stored in collections and collections are stored in a database.

#### Creating a database and collection:
```
use newdb //creates  a database vi name newdb
db.createCollection("col1") // creates a collection via name col1

show collections //list all the collections within db;
```

#### The _id field:
---
Every document has a _id field and it acts as a primary key for the document.
Mongodb automatically creates a unique index on this key.
The "_id" field can have any BSON type as its value, except for array. 

Most popular values to be stored in _id include:
- ObjectID
- Autoincrement values
- UUID
- unique code

#### What is an object ID ?

Object Ids consists of 12 bytes.
- First 4 bytes, contains time.
- Next 3 bytes, machine id
- Next 2 bytes, process id
- Next 3 bytes, counter

#### Mongodb Strings
Mongodb stores string values as UTF-8 by default. 
Thus, can handle all international characters and languages without any settings change.

All the keys in a mongodb document needs to be of string type.
